Multi Server BTC Lightning Payment Terminal

Icripto POS is a payment terminal that allow vendors to receive payments in bitcoin.
The app does not connect to any centralized backend. 
It only connects to the server the user chooses to (BTCPay, LNBits and/or BUDA.com)

The terminal currently supports:
- Connection to BTCPay Server for accepting payments in bitcoin (on chain and lightning, plus altcoins via plugins).
- Connection to LNBits Server for accepting payments in bitcoin (on chain and lightning).
- Connection to Buda.com for accepting payments in bitcoin (lightning).

TODOs:
Enabling payments to Buda.com with bitcoin onchain.
Enabling connections to LNBits and BTCPay Servers hosted behind onion addresses.
Enabling payments via NFC cards to BTCPay Servers.
